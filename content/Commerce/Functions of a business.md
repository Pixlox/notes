Businesses (big or small) are important to the Australian economy. They have the important roles of:

1. [[#Profit]]
2. [[#Providing employment]]
3. [[#Providing income]]
4. [[#Consumers choice to purchase goods and services]]
5. [[#Improve quality of life]]


### Profit
---
- [[Profits|Profit]] is sales revenue, minus expenses. 
- Revenue is the payment received for providing goods or services.
- Expenses are the costs of operating a business

Business owners take high risk of operating their businesses. Risk is the uncertainty and the possibility of incurring a loss of a business.

Owners could lose some or all of their business investment if risks cannot be managed properly.


### Providing employment
---
- Business owners need to hire people to work for them. 
- Hence, businesses provide jobs to people. This is called [[employment]].

During the period where businesses are earning a high profit, they are likely to employ more people to work for them. 

However, during downturns with less sales, they are less likely to employ more people.


### Providing income
---
- Employees are paid for their labour services.
- This can either be via a [[Wages|wage]] or a [[Salaries|salary]].

Business owners earn their income in the form of profit, as mentioned previously.

### Consumers choice to purchase goods and services
---
- Consumers have choices to purchase goods and services.
- The more competition, the more choices are available.

This benefits the general society because businesses have to provide high quality goods and services at a cheap price, to compete with the rest of the market.

If there are a lack of competitors (or none), consumers have to pay a higher price, with possible poor quality of the goods and services. This is known as a monopoly.

### Improve quality of life
---
- Quality of life refers to the living standards and wellbeing of an individual. 
- This consists of material and non material benefits.

#### Examples
- Consumers can afford to buy more goods and services due to higher income, to satisfy their needs and wants.
- When businesses are more socially responsible by being environmentally friendly in their production process, which reduces wastage and pollution.
