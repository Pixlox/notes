- The gig economy is where workers are hired to complete a particular job over a period of time. They often *work on demand*.
- It has previously been called the "sharing economy".
- The gig economy typically relies on a digital platform to bring workers and jobs together. Technology has greatly facilitated this change in the workforce.
