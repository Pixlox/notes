Major groups in the workplace can include:
- [[#Unions]]
- [[#Employer associations]]

### Unions
---
- Trade unions are organisations which look after worker's rights and conditions in an industry.
- Employees can approach and bargain with employers through a union for better wages, working conditions, fair treatment, and more.
- In 1927, the Australian Council of Trade Unions (ACTU) was formed and all individual unions became affiliated with the ACTU.


#### Union decline
Union membership since then has declined, because of economic restructuring in the heavily unionised manufacturing sector.

- In the 1950s, union membership was ~60% of the workforce. In 2022, this is now ~12%.
- Younger workers are less likely to a part of a union.
- This can potentially have happened because of the rise of casual / part-time work.


### Employer associations
---
- Employer associations are organisations formed by employees or businesses within a specific industry or sector. 
- They represent the interest and concerns of the employers.

The role of employer associations is to:
- Represent employers at national wage cases
- Provide advice and assistance on issues such as tax.
