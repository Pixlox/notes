*Economics* is a term that is generally used to refer to how a nation tries to *satisfy* people's needs and wants. There are *three* main players in our nation's economy - *consumers*, businesses/employers and *governments* - and they all work together, trying to solve the economic problem of choosing which needs and wants to satisfy with their limited *resources*.

A nation's economy is also affected by other nation's economies through the trade of *exports* and *imports*.
