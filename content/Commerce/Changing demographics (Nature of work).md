An example of changing demographics can be found in the increase of women in the workforce.

- In *1966*, most Australians who worked were men, few women were present in the workforce.
- In *2020*, women make up 47.4% of all persons employed in the workforce. Of these, 25.8% are [[Full time employment|full time]], and 21.6% are [[Part time employment|part time]].
- As of *February 2023* - data from the ABS indicates that men's workforce participation is 71.2%, compared to 62.2% for women.
- Inclusivity for women, people with disabilities, and different ethnic backgrounds has increased over the years.
- The increase in flexible working conditions also allow women to balance work and family commitments.

**All of this has resulted in the change in cultural perception that women can thrive in their career.**
