Proportional representation / optional preferential:
- When you vote for a senator, you will be given a white ballot paper. You can vote in two ways:
- Place the number 1 in the box beside the party of your choice on the top. This means any distribution of preferences will follow that party's instructions.
- Or, rank by placing a number beside *every* name on the bottom of the form.
