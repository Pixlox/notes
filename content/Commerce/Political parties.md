Political parties are groups of people who band together because they share the same views that they think are important.

Their main aim of parties is to get candidates elected into Parliament so as to influence the decisions of government.

All political parties must be registered with the AEC (Australian Electoral Commission). There are two requirements for this registration:
- The aims of the party must be submitted.
- The party must have at least 500 eligible voters, unless the party already has a member in parliament.

Not all candidates belong to a political party. Some may be independents.


### Labor
---
- The Australian Labour Party (ALP) was established in the 1980s.

The ALP's policies promote social justice, compassion and a fair go for all. Its main aims are to:
- Ensure wealth and power are more evenly and fairly shared in society.
- Provide jobs for everyone who wants to work.
- Abolish poverty and improve the living standards of all Australians.
- Ensure that all Australians can obtain the education, housing and community services they need.
