- A credit rating is an independent assessment of the ability of a corporation or a government to repay a [[Debt]], either in general terms or regarding a specific financial obligation.
- Credit scores are assigned to individuals based on their personal history of acquiring and repaying [[Debt]]. They are checked by lenders considering loaning money to a consumer.
- Credit ratings are letter grades ranging from AAA at the top to C or D at the bottom.

### Borrowing
- When asking for a loan, you have to convince the lender that you can repay it on a regular basis. Hence, it is important to have good credit rating; which is the history of repayment.

Credit rating is affected by:
- Character: personal ability to pay their bills with NO previous credit default.
- Capacity: this refers to the person's current [[Income]] and the level of existing [[Debt]].
- Collateral: assets used as security for the loan. If the borrower cannot repay, the assets will be forfeited.
