The circular flow model is an economic model that shows the flow of money through the economy.

It shows the connections between the *five* sectors of an economy:
- [[#Consumers]]
- [[#Businesses]]
- [[#Financial Institutions]]
- [[#Government]]
- [[#Overseas]]

### Consumers
---
- Consumers or households **earn an [[income]]** from the factors of production (land, labour, capital or enterprise). With this [[income]] they **purchase goods and services** from firms to satisfy their needs and wants.

In summary:
- Money that flows in - income ([[Wages|wage]], [[Salaries|salary]]) (Y)
- Money that flows out - consumption (C)

### Businesses
---
Businesses **produce goods and services** for consumers, and **buy resources** from the household sector. This can be:
- **Labour:** expertise, skills and time to produce the goods and services.
- **Financial Resources:** cash flow for businesses to operate and expand their production from the sale of goods and services.

In summary:
- Money that flows in - sales revenue in exchange for G&S
- Money that flows out - income ([[wages]], [[Salaries|salary]]) in exchange for resources


### Financial Institutions
---
- Financial Institutions are the *intermediaries* between savers and borrowers.
- For example: banks, [[superannuation]] funds, trusts and insurance companies.
- They receive **savings (S)** from individuals and businesses and then lend to the borrowers (which can also be *other* individuals and businesses) as **Investment (I).**
- Savings (S) are put away for future use, this is a **leakage**.
- Investment (I) is used for businesses to expand and grow their businesses and for consumers to purchase other items. This is an **injection.**

### Government
---
Governments raise revenue from [[Taxes]] (T). This can be income tax, business tax, GST, stamp duty, payroll tax, as **leakage.**

- They then use this revenue to provide goods and services to the community as **Government Expenditure (G).** 
- This includes education, healthcare, infrastructure, welfare payments, etc, as **injection.**

In summary:
- Money that flows in - government expenditure
- Money that flows out - taxation revenue (T)

### Overseas
---
This consists of exporters and importer from the rest of the world.

- Exports are sold by Australian firms to foreign countries (such as wool, iron ore and coal)
- Imports are bought by Australians from foreign countries (such as electronics)

In summary:
- Money that flows in - exports (X)
- Money that flows out - imports (M)
