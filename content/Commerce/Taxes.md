- Employees have the responsibilities and obligations to pay tax.
- In Australia, the employers usually deduct a certain amount of an employees pay, and send it to the Australian Taxation Office (ATO). This is called Pay As You Go (PAYG).
- Then, at the end of the financial year, when you complete your tax return, you will know whether you will receive a tax credit, or if you need to pay extra.

### Business tax 
---
For businesses taxes are slightly different:
- If the annual sales of the business is less than 50 million, then the tax rate is 25% of the net profit.
-  If the annual sales of the business is more than 50 million, then the tax rate is 30% of the net profit.

### Tax fraud
---
Assuming a hypothetical business is *not* a listed company in the share market, and it wants to minimise its tax expenses (unethically and illegally), what can it do?

**Tax fraud.** By either lying to the ATO that its sales is actually much lower, or overstating expenses. However, this is illegal and can lead to jail.
