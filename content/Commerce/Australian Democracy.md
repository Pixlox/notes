Australia runs on a representative democracy; eligible people vote for candidates to carry out the business of governing on their behalf.

The Australian democracy has at its heart, the following core defining values:
- Freedom of election and being elected
- Freedom of assembly and political participation
- Freedom of speech, expression and religious belief
- Rule of law
- Other basic human rights: eg. rights to live, safety

### Basic principles of Australia's political system
---
- Separate people for the Head of State (The King) and Head of the Government (Prime Minister)
- 2 Houses of Parliament â€” Lower and Upper House
- 3 Separate Sections of Government
	- **The Parliament Legislature** to make laws
	- **The Executive** to administer laws and carry out the government's business
	- **Judiciary (or courts)** to enforce the laws

The power to make laws (Legislative) is separate from the power to put the laws into action (Executive). These two arms are different from the power to enforce the law and settle the dispute (Judiciary).

### Separation of Powers
---
- The [[The constitution||Constitution]] distributes the power to govern between the Parliament, the Executive and the Judiciary to avoid any group having all the power.
- Each group should work within a defined area of responsibility to keep a check on the actions of the others.
- Citizens can vote for new and different government if their laws and policies are unpopular.
- People's freedom and rights will be protected.
