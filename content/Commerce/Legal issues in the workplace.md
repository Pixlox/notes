### Bullying in the workplace
---
- As much as 85% of employees have suffered or witnessed bullying in their workplace. Bullying can be repeated and ongoing.
- Examples of bullying in the workplace include: humiliation, intimidation, verbal abuse, touching, violence, threats and exclusions.


### Sexual harassment
---
- Sexual harassment is any behaviour with sexual nature that can make a person uncomfortable, feel humiliated or offended.
- Sexual harassment is illegal according to the Anti-Discrimination Act 1997 and Sex Discrimination Act 1984.
- Some examples include: a joke on someone's appearance, displaying inappropriate images, or unwanted touching.
- If the offender says "It's only a joke", that is **not** a defence statement and the offender can face potential prosecution.


### Anti discrimination
---
- Discrimination is bias of treating employees differently or less favourably.
- Discrimination is illegal and it can be in the form of: gender, age, ethnicity, sexual preference, religion, political opinion, disability, etc.
- An example is female workers have difficulty getting promotions, unequal pay rates, dismissal of older workers, migrants workers or those from Non-English speaking backgrounds.

#### Anti-discrimination acts
- Racial Discrimination Act 1975: based on a particular racial background
- Sex Discrimination Act 1984: cannot discriminate based on sex, pregnancy, family responsibilities etc. 
- Disability Discrimination Act 1992: people with disability have equal access to employment 
- Age Discrimination Act 2004: cannot discriminate base on age 
- Affirmative Action Act 1986: promote equal employment opportunities


### Unfair dismissal
---
- Unfair Dismissal is when the termination of employment is harsh, unjust & unreasonable and is considered illegal.
- Employees who believe they have been unfairly dismissed can apply to the Fair Work Commission for reinstatement or compensation.

#### Fair dismissal methods
- If an employee is not performing his/her job satisfactorily or behaving inappropriately, the employer can dismiss that person legally. 
- There are 3 methods.
- Summary dismissal: this is a serious breach of employment contract. E.g. fraud, assault.
- Dismissal by notice: fail to perform the job appropriately (need 3 warning letters).
- Redundancy: where the employee is no longer needed to perform. Employees are paid out a redundancy package as agreed in the employment contract. This *might not* be a *bad* thing for employees.
