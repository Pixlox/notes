You've passed the resume screening stage, the next hurdle is the interview. Here are some dos and don'ts.

#### Must do
- Dress appropriately (semi-casual is best for most interviews, however in some cases formal may be required)
- Arrive 15 minutes early, first impressions matter! (not 5 minutes early or even worse, **late**)
- Switch off your phone, or put it on silent / do not disturb
- Research the company (go to their website: *what are their vision and mission statements? what types of goods / services do they offer?*)
- Respect your interviewers in a polite manner
- Speak in a neutral tone and pace, with good non-verbal behaviour (eye contact, hands and leg placements, etc.)
- Prepare some questions to ask the interviewer

#### Do not
- Don't fidget, it can make you seem nervous and leaves a bad impression
- Don't provide unclear answers to the interviewer's questions
- Don't speak negatively about your former or current employer
- Don't lie in response to the interviewer's questions
- Don't get too personal with the interviewer
- Don't sit down before you are invited to
