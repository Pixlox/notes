- Equity is cash received from the sale of shares ownership, ie. inviting more owners into the business.
- The key difference between debt finance and equity finance is that the investor becomes a part-owner of your business and shares any profit the business makes.
- Most shareholders do not expect immediate return.
- Profit has to be shared with the shareholders in the form of dividend. If there is a loss, the loss is *not* shared with the shareholders.
- If the company is listed on the stock exchange, shareholders will also gain by the increase of the share price.
