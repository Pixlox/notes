- Entitlements refer to the rights, benefits and privileges an employee is legally entitled to receive as a part of their employment agreement.
- Remuneration refers to the total compensation or payment that an employee receives for their work and services.
- Perks are additional benefits or advantages that are provided to employees beyond their regular regular [[salaries|salary]] or [[wages]].
- All these entitlements and benefits will be stated in the *employment contract* when you receive your job offer.
- Apart from the salary, you should also consider these benefits before making an acceptance decision.

In order to retain and motivate employees, companies often provide monetary and non-monetary benefits.

**Here are some examples:**
