---
- A part time [[Employment|employee]] is similar to a [[Full time employment|full time employee]], except they work on average less than 38 hours per week.
- They usually work regular hours each week.
- They are entitled to the same benefits as a [[Full time employment|full time employee]], but on a *pro-rata basis*[^1].
- They are a permanent employee, or are on a fixed term contract.

[^1]: Pro-rata basis in this case refers to the amount of benefits a part time employee would get, proportional to the amount of time they have worked compared to a full time employee.
