Australia is a parliamentary democracy in the Anglo-American tradition. Its design was strongly influenced by its British colonial origins and the efforts of Australia's 'founding fathers' to incorporate elements of the American model.

Fenna (2001) identifies four features that characterise Australia's system of government. These are:
- Federalism
- Parliamentary government
- Bicameralism (two houses)
- [[The constitution||Constitution]]

### Democratic Framework
---
A liberal democracy (one that encourages the development and wellbeing of the individual) is organised to define and limit power to promote legitimate government within a framework of justice and freedom.

There are 4 critical elements of the Democratic Framework:
- [[#Legitimacy]]
- Justice
- Freedom
- Power

### Legitimacy
---
A legitimate government is one that has the appropriate mandate / authority to rule. This usually means a high degree of popular support as demonstrated by a free electorate and frequent elections.

This is such that the general population can cast their opinions on who should represent them in the government.

### Justice
---
Justice is achieved when citizens live in an environment where they are treated equally with dignity and respect.

This may occur in a representative democracy that is tempered by constitutionalism, free elections and restraints on power.

### Freedom
---
Freedom must have the following characteristics:
- Self determination such that citizens may make decisions, learn from them and accept responsibility
- Capacity to choose between alternatives (ie. choices)
- People have the power to do what the law does not forbid; and prohibitions should be for the common good.
- Respect for political and civil liberties.

### Power
---
There should be efforts being made to define and limit power, often by means of a written constitution.

Checks and balances, such as the separation of Parliament, senior government and judicial power, and instituted. In addition, there are conventions of behaviour and a legal system that complements the political system.


### Laws, values and morals
---
Laws are sets of rules which everyone in the community is expected to obey. Laws are enforced by the police and the courts, hence they are legal rules (eg. traffic laws).

Without laws, people can do whatever they like, leading to possible chaos, disorder and confusion (ie. anarchy).

Law has 4 main roles:
- Establish boundaries of acceptable behaviour and determine what will not be tolerated. (eg. texting and driving, stealing)
- Protect from the action of others and provide safety. (eg. people cannot assault others)
- Set a framework of what people can do. (eg. people can get married, operate a business)
- Resolve disputes to prevent people taking the law into their own hands (eg. the police force, court system).

People develop a sense of what is and wrong from their beliefs, attitudes and values.

Laws reflect a society's widely held values and morals. (eg. people believe murder is a serious crime).
