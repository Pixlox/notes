### Main factors that impact the supply of a good / service
---
- [[#Cost of production]]: the price of materials, such as labour, rent or materials.
- [[#Productivity / efficiency]]: the speed and accuracy with which you can make your product.
- [[#Prices of other goods / services]]: consumers typically choose the most cost-effective.
- [[#The number of suppliers]]: how many others are offering the same thing?

### Cost of production
---
- Suppliers pay for a variety of things, including raw materials, labour (staff), rent and electricity / gas / internet.
- Suppliers put most of their efforts into producing the most cost effective product.

### Productivity / efficiency
---
- Productivity refers to the amount that is produced, and efficiency to the effectiveness of turning resources into products with minimal waste.
- As productivity and/or efficiency increase, the supply will also increase.
- Efficiency and productivity can increase because: more workers are employed, workers become better at their jobs, and / or new technology is used.

### Prices of other goods / services
---
- If the price of the substitute increases, customers are more likely to want the cheaper alternative.
- Therefore suppliers of the cheaper good will produce more to maximise profit.
- If the price of the alternative decreases, customers will prefer that good, so you will supply less of your more expensive good.

### The number of suppliers
---
- As more suppliers enter the market producers will supply less of their product because not as many people will buy it.
