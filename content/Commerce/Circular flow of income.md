- Injections are money entering into the economy.
- Leakages are money leaving the economy.
- When injections are greater than leakages, the economy is expanding: economic growth.
- When injections are less than leakages, the economy is contracting.
- When injections are the same as leakages, the economy is at equilibrium (extremely unlikely to happen).

| Contraction           | Equilibrium           | Expansion |
| --------------------- | --------------------- | --------- |
| S + T + M > I + G + X | S + T + M = I + G + X | S + T + M < I + G + X          |
