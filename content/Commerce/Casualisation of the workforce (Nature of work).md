Casualisation refers to the change of traditional working practices such that more people are employed on a [[Casual employment|casual]] / [[Part time employment|part-time]] basis.

- Casual workers currently make up ~25% of the workforce.
- Industries such as retail and hospitality employ nearly **half** of their entire labour force as casuals.
- [[Flexible working conditions (Nature of work)]] means an agreed change of working arrangements. This can include **the hours, pattern and location of work.** 
- Ideally, it allows employees to balance personal commitments.
