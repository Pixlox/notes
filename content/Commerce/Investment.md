### Reasons for Savings & Investment
---
People can choose to spend or save (invest) from their income. People can use their saving to invest, so that their value will increase.

- The *more* a person spends, the less savings he or she will have.
- The *less* a person spends, the more savings he or she will have.

### Shares
---- 
- Potential capital gains
- Potential income as dividends
- Lower tax rates on long-term capital gains

### Risk and Return
---
Reasons for investing:
- Future major purchases (eg. property, car)
- Personal Commitments (eg. wedding, having children)
- Extra income from investment
- Retirement (especially since nowadays people can live longer)

#### Income
- Regular income: rent, dividend, coupon payments. These are being paid to the owners at a regular interval (eg. monthly, half-yearly)
- Capital Gains: this is the profit earn when selling the investment asset. This is calculated by subtracting from the purchasing price. Logically, you buy low and sell high.

#### Rate of return
- Rate of return (ROR) is the profit earned as a % of the original investment.
- If it is a loss, the ROR would be negative.
- Of course, the higher the ROR, the better.
- The basic rule of investment is: *the higher the rate of return, the higher the risk of losing your money.* The more it fluctuates, the more the chance for significant gain, but so is the probability of loss as well.

### How to avoid investing failure
---
Wise investors spread out their investment (some are risky, some are safe) by having a wide range of investments or a balanced portfolio. This is called diversification.

Don't put all your eggs in one basket.


### Different types
---
- Term deposits: deposit a fixed amount into a financial institutions for a specific period without any cash withdraw. The rates are better than a normal saving account.
- [[Superannuation]]: employers have to pay an additional 11.5% of your [[Wages]] into a [[Superannuation]] fund which is invested. When you have retired, then you can access the fund.
- Shares (or Equities): partial ownership of a company. When the company is making a profit, investors receive a dividend.
