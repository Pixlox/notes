- Personal Commitments (eg. wedding, having children)
- Extra income from investment
- Retirement (especially since nowadays people can live longer)

#### Income
- Regular income: rent, dividend, coupon payments. These are being paid to the owners at a regular interval (eg. monthly, half-yearly)
- Capital Gains: this is the profit earn when selling the investment asset. This is calculated by subtracting from the purchasing price. Logically, you buy low and sell high.

#### Rate of return
- Rate of return (ROR) is the profit earned as a % of the original investment.
- If it is a loss, the ROR would be negative.
- Of course, the higher the ROR, the better.
