### Setting up a new business
---
Potential entrepreneurs would consider setting up a new business because:

- A new idea, invention or solution has been created.
- Other existing businesses cannot satisfy the needs of customers (ie. market gap).
- The market has grown and existing businesses cannot support additional customers.

**There are advantages and disadvantages to setting up a new business.**

### Purchasing an existing business

- This is to buy a business that is already operating and everything that is associated with it. This includes: stock, equipment, staff, reputation, existing customer base and goodwill.
- Goodwill is an intangible asset recorded when one company acquires another. It concerns brand reputation, intellectual property and customer loyalty.
- It is critical to investigate the reason behind the sale of business because existing owners will always (and only) present the best side of the business.
- Researching about its history and obtaining legal & financial advice is highly recommended.
