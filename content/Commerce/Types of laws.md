There are two ways of making laws:
1. Ones that are written down beforehand are called Statute Law, or Acts of Parliament.
2. Ones that are developed piece by piece by judges, this is called Common Law.

Common law and statute law are followed by most nations in the world. In Australia, the law is combination of both.

### Common Law

Common Law refers to the decision given by judges. It may occur because a judge has to decide on a case where there is no existing law that regulates it. 

It is up to the judge to make a decision. These decisions need to be recorded in law reports so that they can be referred to.

These decisions are referred to as Legal Precedents.

Judges do not deliberately attempt to change or make a law; they are trying to resolve the dispute before them. They will try to make similar decisions in cases that are alike. This can help the legal system to achieve fairness and justice in the system.


### Statute Law

In Australia, the laws created in the Federal Parliament have the highest status and must be obeyed by all the people. Parliament makes most of the laws.

Each state and territory has its own parliament as well. The State Parliament delegates some of its law-making power to local councils, looking after areas related to them.
