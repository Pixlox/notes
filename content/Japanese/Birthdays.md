### Asking for someone's birthday
---
To ask for someone's birthday, you can either use いつ or {何|なん}{月|がつ}{何|なん}{日|にち}. Both work, however いつ is obviously shorter, so we'll use that in this example. 

> [!info] おたんじょうび is used in this example to sound more polite, however simply たんじょうび is acceptable as well.

**Q:** おたんじょうびはいつですか？
When is your birthday?

**A:** ([[Months|month]]) ([[Dates|date]]) です。
It is on ([[Months|month]]) ([[Dates|date]]).
