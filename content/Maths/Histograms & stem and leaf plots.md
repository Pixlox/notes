- A frequency histogram is a column graph of numerical data where the columns stand together without gaps between them.

- A frequency polygon is a line graph that is constructed by joining the midpoints of the tops of the columns of a frequency histogram, starting and ending on the horizontal axis. It is called a polygon because the graph and the horizontal axis together make a shape with a straight sides.
