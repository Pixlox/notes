- **Divergent boundaries:** These are areas where plates move away from each other, causing magma to rise from the mantle to the surface.
- **Convergent boundaries:** These are areas where plates move towards each other. If an oceanic and continental plate collide, the denser oceanic plate is forced underneath the continental plate in a process called subduction, forming a trench and possibly leading to volcanic activity.
- **Transform boundaries:** These are areas where plates slide past each other horizontally. This action can cause powerful earthquakes.
