#### Conduction
- Hot to cold
- When particles gain energy, they vibrate more and collide.
- This allows the free [[Electrons]] to spread the heat energy.

#### Convection
- Liquids and gases (fluids)
- When particles gain more energy, they move further apart because hot things expand
- The fluid gets less dense, and they move to the top. The denser parts of the fluid move to the bottom.

#### Radiation
- Infrared Radiation is a wave, being sent at the speed of light.
- An example of IR Radiation is the heat from the sun.
- Black absorbs more radiation, but also emits more radiation. In colder environments, you will lose more heat with black.
- White reflects radiation.
