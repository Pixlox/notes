- A proton is a positively charged sub-atomic particle found in the nucleus of an atom. 
- It is a building block of matter and has a relative mass of 1. 
- It plays a crucial role in determining the identity of the atom because the number of protons in the nucleus defines the element.
- There **must** be the same amount of protons as there are [[Electrons|electrons]].
