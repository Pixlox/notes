Atoms consist of three main subatomic particles: [[Protons|protons]], [[Neutrons|neutrons]], and [[Electrons|electrons]].

- [[Protons]] are found in the nucleus of the atom and are positively charged.
- [[Neutrons]] are found in the nucleus as well, however, they have no charge (neutral).
- [[Electrons]] are found outside the nucleus and have a negative charge. 
- In between the nucleus and the electron lies empty space. Most of an atom is made up of empty space.

Protons and neutrons have approximately the same mass, while electrons have a much lower mass, of 1/1840 of one proton.
