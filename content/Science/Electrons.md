---
- An electron is a negatively charged subatomic particle that orbits around the nucleus of an atom in 'shells'. 
- It is much smaller in mass compared to [[Protons|protons]] and [[Neutrons|neutrons]] and has a relative mass of approximately 1/1840. 
- Electrons are responsible for chemical bonding and the behaviour of atoms in chemical reactions.
- There must be the same amount of electrons as there are [[Protons|protons]].
