- Voltage is the measure of the 'push' given by an electrical field, and is measured in volts (V).
- Current is a measure of the number of electrons flowing, and is measured in amps (I).
- Resistance is a measure of how much a material opposes the flow of current, and is measured in ohms (Ω).
- Ohm's Law states that the current in a [[Basic circuits|circuit]] is directly proportional to the voltage and inversely proportional to the resistance: I = V/R.
- Power is the rate at which work is done, and is often measured in watts (W).

#### Quick Terms
- Voltage (V): the measure of the "push" given by an electrical field.
- Current (I): a measure of the number of electrons flowing.
- Resistance (R): a measure of how much a material opposes the flow of current.
- Ohms (Ω): the unit of measurement for resistance.
- Amperes (A): the unit of measurement for current.
- Volts (V): the unit of measurement for voltage.
- Power (W): the rate at which work is done, measured in watts (W).

#### Formulas
- V = I x R
- I = V / R
- R = V / I
- Electricity Efficiency = (Useful energy / Total energy) x 100%
