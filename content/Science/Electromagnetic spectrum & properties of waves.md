---
- As the frequency increases, the wavelength decreases.
- What differentiates between frequency and wavelengths is that they are inversely related.
- Remember 'ROYGBIV' for rainbow colours (red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, violet).
- Everything ultraviolet and beyond is *ionising* which means it causes damage to our cells.
- Microwaves and radio waves are used in communication.

#### Wave behaviours

- These are all different ways waves can react when hitting a surface.

| Wave behaviour | Definition                                                                                                                                                                    |
| -------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Transmission   | Transmission is when waves keep travelling in the same direction through an object.                                                                                           |
| Reflection     | Reflection is when waves bounce off an object.                                                                                                                                |
| Refraction     | Refraction is when waves redirect as it passes from one object to another. For example, a pencil dipped in water would refract in another direction where it is in the water. | 
| Diffraction    | Diffraction is the spreading out of waves as they pass through or around objects.                                                                                                                                                                              |
| Absorption     | Absorption is when waves are absorbed by an object. For example, black light absorbs all colours in the spectrum and reflects none.                                           |
| Scattering     | Scattering is when waves are forced to go off their straight path to imperfections in the medium.                                                                                                                                                                          |
