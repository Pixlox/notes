### The particle model
---
- Matter is made of tiny particles
- There is space between the particles
- The particles are in constant motion
- There are forces between the particles

| Property for comparison | Solid             | Liquid                         | Gas                   |
| ----------------------- | ----------------- | ------------------------------ | --------------------- |
| **Shape**               | Has a fixed shape | Can change its form, not fixed | Not fixed, no shape   |
| **Particle bonds**      | Very strong       | Stro ng                        | Weak                  |
| **Particle spacing**    | Tightly packed    | Small amount of space          | Large amount of space |
| **Particle movement**   | Slow              | Fast                           | Faster                |
