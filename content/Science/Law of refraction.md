### Background information
---
- For background information on these experiments look at: [[Law of reflection#Background information|Background information]]

### Aim
---
To determine the relationship between the angle of incidence and the angle of reflection.

### Equipment list
---
- Power pack
- Ray box
- Narrow light slit adapter
- Ruler
- Protractor
- Glass prism

### Method
---
1. Connect the ray box to the power pack's DC terminals and turn the power pack to 6 volts
2. Place the narrow slit adaptor into the slit furthest from the light bulb in the ray box.
3. Take the glass prism from the ray box and trace along its sides on a piece of A4 paper with a pencil.
4. At the midpoint of the prism's side, draw the normal vertically.
5. Place the rectangular prism back on the piece of paper from where you traced it.
6. Using the ray box, shine a single beam of light at the point where the normal & prism meet.
7. Using a pencil, draw 3 dots on the incident ray and on the reflected ray.
8. Join the dots on the incident & reflected ray.
9. Using a protractor, measure the angle of incidence and angle of reflection.
10. Repeat steps 3-9 using a different light ray angle
