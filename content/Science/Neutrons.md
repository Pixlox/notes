- A neutron is a subatomic particle that is not charged at all. This means that it is neutral.
- The neutron is also located in the nucleus of an atom. It has a relative mass of 1.
- Neutrons help stabilise the nucleus by adding extra mass without adding any charge.
- The number of neutrons in an atom can vary, creating [[Isotopes|isotopes]] of the same element.
