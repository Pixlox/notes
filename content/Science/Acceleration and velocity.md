- Velocity is speed with direction. We use the symbol "v" to denote velocity, and its unit is metres per second (m/s). As it is a vector quantity it can be a negative value or positive value. For example, it can be 25m/s east. It can be a negative or positive value.

- Acceleration is a change in an object's velocity over time and is measured in meters per second (m/s^2). This means that an object accelerates when it speeds up, slows down or changes direction.

- To calculate acceleration, we need the initial velocity (starting velocity), the final velocity and the time taken.

A = Acceleration (m/s2)
V = Final velocity (m/s)
U = Initial velocity (m/s)
T = Time taken (s)

### Calculating acceleration
---

> $$ a = \frac{{\text{{v - u}}}}{{\text{{t}}}} $$

Another way to think about it is:

  >$$ Acceleration = \frac{{\text{{Change in velocity}}}}{{\text{{Change in time}}}}  $$


**Example:**  A car increases its speed from 10.0 m/s to 20.0 m/s in 2.0 seconds. What is the acceleration?

**Answer:** 20 - 10/2 = *5m/s*
