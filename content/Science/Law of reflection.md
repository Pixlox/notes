### Background information
---
- **Normal:** The perpendicular line drawn to the reflective surface.
- **Incident ray:** The ray of light hitting the reflective surface.
- **Reflective ray:** The ray of light coming *off* the reflective surface.
- **Angle of incidents:** The angle between the normal and the incident ray.
- **Angle of reflection:** The angle between the normal and the reflective ray.

### Aim
---
To determine the relationship between the angle of incidents and the angle of reflection.


### Equipment list
---
- Power pack
- Ray box
- Narrow light slit adapter
- Ruler
- Protractor
- Flat mirror


### Method
---
1. Connect the ray box to the power pack's DC terminals and turn the power pack to 6 volts.
2. Place the narrow slit adapter into the slit furthest from the light bulb in the ray box.
3. Take the flat mirror from the ray box and trace along its surface on the edge of a piece of paper, with a pencil.
4. At the midpoint of the line that was just drawn, draw the normal.
5. Place the flat mirror back on the piece of paper where you traced it.
6. Take the ray box and shine a single beam of light at the point where the normal meets the mirror.
7. Using a pencil place 3 dots in the middle of the incident ray, and 3 dots in the middle of the reflected ray.
8. Join the first 3 dots to the point where the normal meets the surface, then repeat this with the other 3 dots.
9. Measure the angle of incidents and the angle of reflection.
10. Repeat steps 3-9 using a different light ray angle.
