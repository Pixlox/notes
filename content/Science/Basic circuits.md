- Series circuit: a circuit in which the components are connected in a single loop, so the same current flows through all of them. It is the "one off, all off" circuit.
- Parallel circuit: a circuit in which the components are connected in branches, so the current is divided between them.
- Insulator: a material that does not conduct electricity well, such as rubber or plastic.
- Conductor: substance which allows electricity to flow through it.
- AC (alternating current): a current that can flow in both directions, that can alternate between them.
- DC (direct current): a current that flows in one direction.
