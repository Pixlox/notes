### Overview
---
A stimulus is any change in an organismâ€™s environment that causes to the organism to react. It is a fancy way of saying 'cause'.

A response is how the organism reacts to a stimulus and results in a change in behaviour. It is a fancy way of saying 'effect'.

Plants also respond to their environment. They are called **tropisms**.

#### Example:
You are hungry, so you eat some food.

**Stimulus:** You are hungry
**Response:** So you eat some food.

### External Stimuli and Internal Stimuli
---
### Internal stimulus
An external stimulus is a stimulus that comes from outside an organism.
##### Example:
- You feel cold so you put on a jacket.
- A snake lunges at a rabbit so it runs away.

### External stimulus
An external stimulus is a stimulus that comes from inside an organism.
#### Example:
- You feel hungry so you eat some food.
- A cat feels thirsty so it drinks water.

### Responding to stimuli
---
**Animals can respond to stimuli in two ways:**
1. In a way that they learned. We call this learned behaviour.
2. In a way that they were just born knowing how to do. We call this instinct.

### Learned behaviour
Learned behaviour is a response to a stimulus that an animal was taught.
##### Example:
- Chimps and monkeys learning to use tools
- Bear teaching her cubs to fish
