Slide 2 

The video will be about a small community who don’t have enough space to expand their village to improve their living conditions. This will allow the people to experience recreational things like sport as they are limited to being a village on top of the water. 

  

Slide 3 

1. What happens in the video? 
    

The video is about kids in a small village near the water who aspire to become football players. They always watched it on TV but didn’t have the space to make an actual football pitch. The boys came together and built a wood football pitch above the water. They practised on it everyday and slowly became better. One day, there was a flyer about a tournament, so the boys packed their stuff and travelled to the venue. Overall they came 3rd place, extremely proud of their achievement. 

2. What group is being represented?
    

The group being presented are the kids for who want to become world football champions but are limited from their surroundings.

3. Why did the composer choose to shape your thoughts this way? What were they trying to make you feel/think? 
    

The composer was trying to make you think that anything is possible. They presented that even though you live in restricted conditions if you put your mind towards something anything can come true. The video touched on the heart making many scenes relatable to our lives 

4. How has watching the whole clip and discussing it affirmed/challenged your initial ideas about the text?
    

I never knew that they wanted to pursue soccer. I did get part of it right as I thought they wanted more space to place sports. It is a very interesting idea whilst also being a smart one too.
