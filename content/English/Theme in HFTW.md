| Everyone deserves a second chance                           | Paula calls Ricky ‘a bad egg’ and he has been in trouble in the past. Bella gives Ricky a second chance. She doesn’t write him off, instead she shows him love and support. The hottie (hot water bottle) she leaves in his bed each night shows him that she cares about him.                                                    | The close up of the hot water bottle symbolises both physical and emotional warmth. That which we presume Ricky has not experienced in his life                                                                                  |
| Dealing with conflict together can strengthen relationships | Ricky and Heck originally despised each other, throwing insults and fighting constantly, but after Heck's unfortunately timed ankle-break they were both forced to support each other. This was further enhanced after their encounter with some more people they found in the cabin, which Ricky and Heck together both defused. | The method of which Heck and Ricky are forced to bond together is through unfortunate conflict; in the form of Heck's injury and their chase with the police. Together they overcome these and have multiple successful escapes. |
