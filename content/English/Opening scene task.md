Discuss how Waititi utilised [[Mise en scene]] to set the tone and begin the characterisation of at least one [[Character descriptions|character in the film]].

### PEEL Paragraph
---
Waititi makes use of mise en scene rigorously throughout the film to develop the relationship between Heck and Ricky.  This can most evidently be shown through the angles used to depict both of them. For example, towards the start of the film, Ricky is often shown alone in shots, in close-ups, and in dark environments, reflecting his mental state. After meeting Bella, we can see Ricky change, and start to appreciate his newfound family. We can see Ricky shown in many shots, and we can see him appear outgoing as well.

The true plot, relationship and intense characterisation begin once Ricky and Heck encounter Bellaâ€™s unexpected death. This plunges both Ricky and Heck into an unstable mental state, and Waititi yet again employs those sad, gloomy and dark angles to emphasise this. Ricky shows us this by faking his own suicide and attempting to run away into the wilderness. Heck eventually finds a surviving Ricky, but sprains his ankle convincing him to go back. This forces the two to work and survive together in the wilderness, which further improves their bond and their character.
