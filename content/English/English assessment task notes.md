### Scene 1: Ricky settles in 
---
This scene introduces us to Ricky Baker, a troubled 13-year-old boy who has been placed in foster care. He is initially reluctant to adjust to his new life with Bella and Hec, a middle-aged couple who live in the New Zealand bush. However, he eventually begins to bond with them, and they start to feel like a real family. This scene is significant because it shows the beginning of Ricky's journey of self-discovery.

He is starting to learn what it means to be loved and accepted, and he is beginning to feel like he belongs somewhere. The scene is also notable for its humour and warmth, which help to offset the darker themes of the film. Here are some specific details from the scene that support my analysis: Ricky is initially hostile and withdrawn. He refuses to talk to Bella and Hec, and he spends most of his time sulking in his room. 

However, he eventually starts to open up to them, and they begin to bond over shared interests, such as fishing and reading. Bella is a kind and patient woman who is determined to help Ricky. She sees the good in him, even when he doesn't see it in himself. Hec is a gruff and eccentric man, but he also has a big heart. He loves Ricky like a son, and he is willing to do whatever it takes to protect him. This scene is a turning point for Ricky. It is the moment when he begins to let go of his anger and resentment and start to open himself up to the possibility of love and belonging.

### Scene 2: Rickyâ€™s First Days in the Forest
---
This scene takes place after Ricky has run away from home and is living in the forest with Hec. It shows Ricky struggling to survive in the wild, but also learning to appreciate the beauty of nature.
   
This scene is significant because it shows Ricky's growing maturity and resilience. He is no longer the angry and withdrawn boy we met at the beginning of the film. He is now a resourceful and determined young man who is learning to take care of himself. 

The scene is also visually stunning, capturing the beauty of the New Zealand bush. Here are some specific details from the scene that support my analysis: Ricky is shown fishing, building a fire, and finding food. He is clearly learning how to survive in the wild. Ricky also takes the time to appreciate the beauty of nature. He stops to admire a waterfall and a flock of birds. This scene shows that Ricky is starting to find a sense of peace and belonging in the forest. He is no longer running away from his problems. He is facing them head-on. 

### Scene 3: Letting go of Zag and Bella 
---
This scene takes place after Bella has died and Ricky and Hec are being chased by the police. Hec is forced to make the difficult decision to let go of Zag, his dog, so that they can escape. Here are some specific details from the scene that support my analysis: Hec is reluctant to let go of Zag. He knows that Zag is a loyal and loving companion. However, Hec also knows that he can't take Zag with him. He would only slow them down. Hec makes the difficult decision to let go of Zag. He knows that it is the right thing to do. This scene is a turning point for both Ricky and Hec. It is the moment when he finally accepts responsibility for his actions and decides to face the consequences. 

These three scenes are all important in the development of Ricky's character. They show us how he is growing and changing as he learns to cope with the challenges of his life. They also highlight the themes of family, love, and belonging that are central to the film.
