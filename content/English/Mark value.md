### What is mark value?
"Mark value" in short answer questions typically refers to the assigned point value or score that a particular question is worth. Each short answer question is assigned a specific mark value which represents the number of points or marks a student can earn by providing a correct and relevant response.

Mark values are indicative of what your answer should require, the length of your response, and the time used to construct it. These mark values are often used to calculate the overall score for an assessment or exam.
