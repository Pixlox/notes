Gross domestic product (GDP) is the monetary value of all the finished goods and services produced within a country’s borders in a specific time period. 

GDP is usually calculated on an annual basis. Put simply, GDP is a broad measurement of a nation’s overall economic activity.


### GDP calculations
- An approximation of the value of goods produced per person in the country, equal to the country’s GDP divided by the total number of people in the country.

> $$ \text{{GDP per capita }} = \frac{{\text{{GDP}}}}{{\text{{Total Population}}}} $$
  
### Criticisms:
1. The statistic does not take into account the underground or unofficial economy: everything from black market activity to under-the-table [[Employment]], as well as other transactions that, for various reasons, are not reported to the government.

2. The tendency of GDP to be interpreted as a gauged of material wellbeing, when in reality it serves as a measure of a nation’s productivity, which are not necessarily related.
