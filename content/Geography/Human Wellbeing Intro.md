1. **How would you define wellbeing?**

Wellbeing would be defined as being physically and mentally stable and comfortable and happy with your current state of life.

2. **What does it mean to have a good life?**

To have a good life means to have fulfilled a purpose, and to have a good state of wellbeing. This can include having little to no financial issues, good quality of life, and good education.

3. **Do all Australians have a good life?**

All Australians may not consider themselves to have a good life. This again, could be due to financial issues, location-based issues, or mental / physical issues. Living in a developed country does *not* mean you will definitely have a good life.

4. **What could be improved in your life, community or country.**

Currently, the cost-of-living in urban areas is inflated. This can push people away from these more developed, urban areas towards more regional, suburban areas. This can take them further away from crucial buildings such as schools and hospitals, which can decrease overall wellbeing.
