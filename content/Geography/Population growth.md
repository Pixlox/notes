### Natural population growth vs net overseas migrations
---
- **Natural population increase** happens as people are born into a country, and decrease as people die.
- **Net overseas migration** is the net gain or loss of population through immigration to a country and emigration from that country.

#### Natural population growth
This projection is based on the estimated resent population on the 31st of December 2019, and assumes growth since then of:
- One birth every 1 minute and 44 seconds
- One death every 3 minutes and 15 seconds
- One person arriving to live in Australia every 3 minutes and 58 seconds
- One Australian resident leaving Australia to live overseas every 7 minutes and 5 seconds
- Which all leads to an overall population increase of one person every 2 minutes and 37 seconds.
