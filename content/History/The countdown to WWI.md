### The Assassination
---
- The Archduke Franz Ferdinand and his wife (from Austria-Hungary) is assassinated in the Bosnian capital, Sarajevo, by Gavrillo Princip, a member of the Serbian terrorist group, the Black Hand. **He was very important, as he was the heir to the Austrian monarchy.**
- After this, Austria-Hungary asks Germany for advice, and Germany gives them a 'Blank Cheque'. **This means that they will support Austria, even if it means war.**

### Ultimatum
---
- Austria-Hungary prepares for war and sends Serbia an ultimatum; hand over the terrorist, or face war.
- Serbia agrees to only *parts* of the ultimatum, so Austria-Hungary declares war on Serbia.
- Russia’s leader Tsar Nicholas II, gives Serbia a blank cheque and prepares for war against Austria-Hungary.
- Germany tells Russia to back down, Russia refuses, so Germany declares war on Russia.
- France has an alliance with Russia, so France declares war on Germany, and Germany declares war on France.

### The schlieffen plan
---
- Realising that it is best to attack France first, Germany attacks France through Belgium. 
- **Goal:** To defeat France in 6 weeks while Russia is still preparing for war and to avoid a *two-front war* (having to fight France and Russia at the same time).
- **Problem:** Belgium is a neutral country and has a treaty with Britain to protect its neutrality.

### The war begins
---
- Britain declares war on Germany, and WWI begins. 
- All British colonies, including Australia, are automatically at war.
