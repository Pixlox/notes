# Stages of the Boxer Rebellion

### Growing unrest
---
By 1898, North Eastern China faced severe hardships, including starvation, droughts, floods, and local corruption, forcing to be burdened with excessive taxes.  The devastating Yellow River flood in the same year triggered a widespread famine that affected 2 million people. Frustration and anger grew among the citizens, leading some to resort to violence. In response to protect villages from looting, a group of Chinese martial artists known as the 'Righteous and Harmonious Fists,' or 'Boxers' as named by the British, emerged. The Boxers intended on ridding China of all foreign influence, which the viewed as the cause of all their problems.

### Anti-western feeling
---
China's humiliating defeat in the last wars, and then the consequent spread of foreign influence caused great resentment towards the foreigners, many Chinese blaming them for their misfortune. Many turned to the Boxers in these tough times, believing the Boxers had mystical powers that would enable them to defeat the foreigners. Boxers looked very intimidating with their bright red turbans, yellow sashes, red-tasselled spears and loud cries.

At first the Boxers attacked Christians, killing thousands of Chinese Christians, chanting slogans such as ‘Destroy what is foreign’ and ‘Destroy the foreign devils’.
