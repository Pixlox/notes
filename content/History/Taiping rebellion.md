### Beginnings
---
- After winning [[The first opium war|the first Opium War]] in 1842, the British forced the Chinese to give them trading concessions and treaty ports, like Shanghai and Canton.
- In the aftermath of the first Opium War, Hong started the Taiping Rebellion, deep in the mountains.
- China's population had nearly trebled, and brought mass poverty and unemployment.
- Due to this, Hong's preachings on social justice found a willing audience.

### The takeover
---
- Hong wanted to create heaven's kingdom on Earth, by overthrowing the corrupt Qing Empire.
- In spring 1850, Hong gave the command for all of the Taiping worshippers to gather together and descend into the plain.
- Hong had an army of over 100,000 men, and they defeated the Qing forces in the South.
- Most of them were poor farmers, miners and labourers; they had nothing to lose.
- Hong then called himself 'The Son of God' and established the Taiping Kingdom.
- On March 19, 1853, Nanjing fell, and Hong was enthroned ruler of God's Heavenly Kingdom.
- Many rules were then put in place. They banned opium, tobacco, alcohol, [[Foot binding|foot binding]], prostitution, gambling, they separated the sexes and more. 
- Most importantly, China was to be classless. All land was to be owned by the state, and distributed by the state.

### Britain's response
---
- At this point, Britain and the Europeans' stake was too big to jeopardise. So they lent their Chinese advisors the latest and best weaponry and eventually, the Qing massed a million men against them.
- In 1864, the Taiping were forced back behind the walls of Nanjing. Within the besieged city, people began to starve. Eventually, Hong fell ill, and died.
- After this the Qing killed every last Taiping leader; thus marking the end of the Taiping Rebellion.
