### Treaty of Versailles
---
Leaders of 32 states representing about 75% of the world's population, attended the Treaty of Versailles. However, negotiations were dominated by 'The Big Three'.

The Big Three were the 3 counties who had the most bargaining power in the Treaty of Versailles. They were:

- Woodrow Wilson - USA
- Lloyd George - Great Britain
- George Clemenceau - France

#### Terms of the Treaty of Versailles (Land)
- Alsace and Lorraine were returned to France.
- Germany lost land to the recreated Poland, Belgium and Denmark.
- The League of Nations was given control of the SAAR region for 15 years, but France had control over its coal fields.
- All the land taken from Russia in the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk had to be returned.
- Germany's overseas empire was taken away to become mandates controlled by the League of Nations (which effectively meant Britain and France controlled them)
- Germany was forbidden to unite with Austria.
- In total, Germany lost 72,500km² of land and between 6-7 million people from the treaty.

#### Terms of the Treaty of Versailles (Military)
- The army was limited to 100,000 men.
- Conscription was banned.
- Germany was not allowed tanks, submarines, or military aircraft.
- The navy could only have 6 battleships.
- The Rhineland had to become a demilitarised zone (DMZ). This meant no German troops were allowed near the French border. The Allies were allowed to keep an army of occupation there for 15 years.

#### Terms of the Treaty of Versailles (Reparations)
- Germany had to pay for the damage caused by the war. These payments were called reparations (These were not a new idea: Germany had forced France to pay £200 million for a year-long war in 1871).
- The sum was set in 1921 at £6,600 million. Germany had to pay a set amount each year,

#### War Guilt & League of Nations
- The War Guilt clause (Clause 231) forced Germany to accept responsibility for the war. This provided the reason for punishing Germany so harshly in the treaty.
- A League of Nations was set up to keep the peace. Germany was *not* allowed to join.
