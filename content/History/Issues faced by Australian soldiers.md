The weaknesses in the Australian defences included:
- Inappropriate khaki uniforms which provided no camouflage and the material was inappropriate for tropical warfare.
- They were a volunteer force, and were largely untrained.
- Some soldiers were used to fighting in desert conditions in the Middle East.
- The terrain was inhospitable and unfamiliar to the Australians.

Illness and injury were very common â€” especially dysentery, dengue fever and malaria.

When our soldiers were sick or injured, the local Papuan people helped us as stretcher carriers. Their service was absolutely invaluable and saved many lives.
