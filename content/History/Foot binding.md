### Overview
---
- Foot binding is practice deeply ingrained in ancient Chinese culture, particularly during the Ming and Qing dynasties.
- It involved the compression and deformation of a young girl's feet to achieve the ideal of small, delicate, and elegant feet.
- It was at that time considered a symbol of status and beauty.
- The foot binding process typically began at a very young age, often between 4 and 6 years old when a girl's bones were still relatively soft, as this practice involved breaking their bones.
- The practice was eventually banned after the fall of the Qing dynasty in the early 20th century.
