### I see, I think, I wonder
---
**I see:** Many men walking up a hill, debris scattered throughout. A horse going out of frame. A carriage going up the hill.

**I think:** These men are going through the debris to most likely either retreat or attack.

**I wonder:** Where this takes place? What is the carriage?


### What is the Kokoda campaign?
---
From 21 July 1942 to 16 November 1942, the Australian 39th Infantry Battalion engaged in a costly battle with Japanese troops determined to capture Port Moresby. The common belief amongst Australians was that if the Japanese captured Port Moresby that the Australian mainland would be next. Therefore, this battle was of vital importance to the Australian war effort.

### Why is it called Kokoda?
---
- The campaign in New Guinea in 1942 was the most important that Australian soldiers have ever been involved in.
- It was the only time in our history, Australians would defend their own territory.
- New Guinea had been an Australian territory since 1920.
- The campaign along what became known as the Kokoda Track, was some of the toughest Australian soldiers have ever experienced.
- Kokoda itself was just a small village about half-way across New Guinea but whole campaign became named after it.

- Australians believed the Japanese were preparing to invade Australia.
- The Japanese wanted to prevent Port Moresby from being used by the US and Australian forces as a military base.
- Success on the Kokoda Track in 1942 was believed to save Australia from a Japanese invasion and greatly assisted the Allied effort to push the Japanese back.
- The Kokoda campaign marked the moment when the war had clearly turned against the Japanese in favour of the allies.

### When did we fight there?
---
- From July to November 1942, Australians were on the Kokoda Track, with fighting being hand to hand and jungle combat.
- We were outnumbered by the Japanese by as much as 7 to 1 at times, however we persevered and eventually the Japanese grew tired.
- By 1943, the Japanese were cleared from almost all of PNG.ghhg
